## 🤖 AI Tools & Development Support

While I built *Joker's Gambit* on my own, I’m deeply grateful for the role that AI development tools have played in accelerating my learning and problem-solving process. As someone still growing in my understanding of C and game development, these tools have been invaluable companions:

- **Grok** – Provided quick insights into game logic and debugging patterns.
- **Claude** – Helped clarify complex concepts and refine code structure.
- **Gemini** – Offered reliable suggestions for optimization and cross-platform considerations.
- **Perplexity** – Assisted in researching best practices and understanding modern C development workflows.
- **Leo (by Brave)** – Supported me throughout the development process with fast, accurate responses and helped me navigate documentation and code challenges.

These tools helped me write the game, learn faster, think more clearly, and overcome roadblocks that would have otherwise taken far longer. While my knowledge and skills are still growing, I’m thankful for the way AI has empowered me to develop at a pace beyond what I thought possible with my current education.

To all the developers, researchers, and engineers behind these systems: thank you for making powerful tools accessible to learners like me.
